 * Opt-in interface for entities that support optimistic locking.

 * (or the convenience {@link EntityDescriptor.Builder#versioned()} for implementors of this
 * interface), the storage backend will enforce optimistic locking on every {@code save()}.
 *
 * <p>The version starts at {@code 0} on the first insert and is incremented by the backend on
 * every successful update. The in-memory entity is updated to reflect the new version after a
 * successful save. If the in-memory version does not match the persisted version at save time,
 * the backend throws {@link OptimisticLockException}.
 *
 * <p>Entities that do not implement this interface (or whose descriptor does not declare version
 * accessors) use plain upsert semantics; optimistic locking is entirely opt-in.
